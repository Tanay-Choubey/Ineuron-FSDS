        "**Ans 1:** The relationship between a class and its instances is a one-to-many relationship. This means that a single class can be used to create multiple instances, which are individual objects that belong to the class. Each instance has its own state and behavior, which is defined by the class, but the instances are distinct from one another and can have different values for their attributes.\n",

You can create multiple instances of the Dog class, such as a spot instance and a rufus instance, which represent two individual dogs. Each instance will have its own attributes, such as breed, name, and age, which can be set to different values for each instance."
