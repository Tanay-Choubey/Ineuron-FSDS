        "\n",
        "**Ans 5:** Text classification is the problem of assigning categories to text data according to its content. The most important part of text classification is feature engineering: the process of creating features for a machine learning model from raw text data. Example: Text cleaning steps vary according to the type of data and the required task. Generally, the string is converted to lowercase and punctuation is removed before text gets tokenized. Tokenization is the process of splitting a string into a list of strings (or “tokens”). We can create a list of generic stop words for the English vocabulary with NLTK (the Natural Language Toolkit), which is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing. Then we can remove these stop words. We need to be very careful with stop words because if you remove the wrong token you may lose important information. For example, the word “will” was removed and we lost the information that the person is Will Smith. With this in mind, it can be useful to do some manual modification to the raw text before removing stop words (for example, replacing “Will Smith” with “Will_Smith”). Stemming and Lemmatization both generate the root form of words. The difference is that stem might not be an actual word whereas lemma is an actual language word (also stemming is usually faster). Those algorithms are both provided by NLTK."
