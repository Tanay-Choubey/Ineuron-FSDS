        "\n",
        "- Searching for patterns in large amounts of text, such as log files or documents\n",
        "\n",
        "- Validating that input matches a certain pattern (e.g. ensuring that a phone number is in a valid format)\n",

        "- Extracting data from text that matches a certain pattern (e.g. extracting all the email addresses from a document)\n",
        "\n",
        "- One of the main benefits of regular expressions is that they can be used to perform these tasks in a very concise and efficient way. They are also very flexible, as they can be easily modified to match different patterns. This makes them a useful tool for a wide range of applications."
