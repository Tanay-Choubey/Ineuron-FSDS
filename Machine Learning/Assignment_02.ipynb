Example: Suppose there is an AI agent present within a maze environment, and his goal is to find the diamond. The agent interacts with the environment by performing some actions, and based on those actions, the state of the agent gets changed, and it also receives a reward or penalty as feedback."

Machines acquire knowledge through experience shared in the form of past data. We have the terms, Knowledge, Skill, and Memory being used to define intelligence. Just because you have good memory, that does not mean you are intelligent."
