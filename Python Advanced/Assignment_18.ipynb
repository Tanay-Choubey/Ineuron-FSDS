The struct package provides a way to pack and unpack this data into Python data types, making it easier to work with."

This is because the shelve module stores the data in a file on disk, and the keys are used to create the file names. In order to maintain the consistency and integrity of the data, the keys must be strings that are valid file names. This is a different restriction than other data dictionaries in Python, which can use any immutable type as a key."
