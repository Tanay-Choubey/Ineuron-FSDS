The Machine Learning systems which are categorized as instance-based learning are the systems that learn the training examples by heart and then generalizes to new instances based on some similarity measure. It is called instance-based because it builds the hypotheses from the training instances. It is also known as memory-based learning or lazy-learning. The time complexity of this algorithm depends upon the size of training data. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O (n), where n is the number of training instances.\n",

To do this, model based algorithms search for optimal values for the model's parameters, often called theta. This searching, or \"learning\", is what machine learning is all about. Model-based system learn by minimizing a cost function that measures how bad the system is at making predicitons on new data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized. To make a prediction, a new instance's features are fed into a hypothesis function which uses the minimized theta found by repeatedly running the cost function."
